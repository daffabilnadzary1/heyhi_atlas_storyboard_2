"""
Director configuration and Gemini client creation.

Contains only:

  * DirectorConfig — all settings the director (L2) reads. The first seven
    fields map 1:1 to schemas.ConfigIn (used by DirectorConfig(**config.json)),
    so renaming them breaks config loading. The remaining fields are internal
    pacing constants, configurable only in code.

  * make_client — the only place the Gemini API key is read.

load_dotenv() runs on import so .env is available everywhere.
