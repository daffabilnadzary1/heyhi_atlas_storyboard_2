"""
patch_blueprint — resolving placeholder char_ids to library ids (L3).

This is the hinge between "the director decided a video needs two characters"
and "the user picked these two". It runs inside /pipeline/select, transactionally
— if it raises, the endpoint deletes selections.json and returns 422, so a run
can never hold a selection whose blueprint was not resolved.

The known gap (open-questions #1) is pinned here too: prompt PROSE is not
rewritten. That test documents current behaviour, not desired behaviour.
