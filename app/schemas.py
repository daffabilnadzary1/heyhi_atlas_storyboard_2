"""
app/schemas.py — Layer 1 request and blueprint schemas.

This file defines both pipeline contracts:

  • Blueprint models (VideoBlueprint, Scene, Storyboard, ...) describe
    blueprint.json, the artifact shared by every layer after the director.
    Changing them changes both what the director may emit and what existing
    blueprints validate against.

  • Request/response models (ConfigIn, DirectIn, ...) define the HTTP API
    exposed by main.py and are independent of stored blueprints.

Pydantic validates structure only. Cross-field rules (character counts,
references, B-Roll constraints, word budgets, etc.) are enforced separately by
director.validate_blueprint and patch_blueprint._check_resolved.
