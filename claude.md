```

**Note**: After one scene of video-with-audio type is generated, integrate it with TTS and trim accordingly before creating the next Veo scene

Output path convention:

```
_storage/atlas_storyboard/run_0X/
├── backgrounds/
├── characters/
├── storyboard/
└── keyframe/
└── music_bg/
```

`run_0X` is set by the user via: `python -m ... --out _storage/atlas_storyboard/run_0X`

## 3. Layer 1 — Source + Config

User-facing entry point. Accepts source files and config. This layer will have a dedicated API to accept response from user.

**Source handling:** `extract.py` converts PDF / DOCX / PPTX / TXT → plain text, which becomes the Director layer's input.

### Config fields

## 4. Layer 2 — Director

Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to interpret the source text + config. Outputs `blueprint.json`.

## 5. Layer 3 — User selects characters + audio

**Goal:** Allows the user to choose a list of characters and audio to use

**Process:**

1. The front-end (which is outside our scope) will display a list of character
2. The user will choose a number of characters based on the blueprint's character_count
3. For every character chosen, the user will choose a certain voice audio (from the audio list)
4. Therefore the same character id across scenes must have the same audio id
5. After the user submits this requests, update the blueprint.json with the chosen character and audio.

**Note**: Will have a dedicated API for this layer

---

## 6. Layer 4 — Asset generation (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)

**Goal:** Generates background, storyboards and keyframes

**Process:**

1. Take the backgrounds/storyboard/keyframes
2. For each backgrounds: loop through bp.backgrounds, generate from .prompt.
3. For each storyboards: loop through bp.storyboard, generate from .prompt + attach .reference images.
4. For each keyframes: loop through bp.keyframe, generate from .prompt + attach the single background reference.
5. Save the background, keyframes and storyboard with their respective id as the file name

**Note**: Characters are NOT generated here — user selects from library in Layer 3.

---

## 7. Layer 5 — Scene generation (Veo 3.1 Fast / Lite)

**Goal:** Generates the video scenes using Veo 3.1

**Process:**

1. Take the scenes properties and pass it into the Veo model
2. Include the reference_from and prompt as an attachment into the Veo's model parameter
3. If the reference_from is a previous scene_id (indicating a continuous shot) this layer should extract the last frame of the previous scene (which is already integrated with external TTS and trimmed accordingly) and use that last frame as an attachment for the image-to-video task.
4. Send parameter to Veo 3.1 Fast for reference-to-video task / send it to Veo 3.1 lite for image-to-video task
5. For each video-with-audio scene that is successfully generated, send it to layer 6 (External TTS), receive the integrated output from layer 6 and continue the next scene. Scenes that are considered B-Roll does not need to be passed to layer 6 (External TTS)

---

## 8. Layer 6 — External TTS

**Goal:** make voice consistent across Veo-generated clips.

**Process, per scene:**

1. Take the scene's `text`.
2. Split it into phrases on punctuation marks.
3. Send each phrase to **Azure TTS** → voiceover clips.
4. Transcribe the Veo clip's native audio with an LLM and run **diarization** to get per-word timings.
5. Overlay the Azure TTS phrases onto the video using those timings (this is what keeps lipsync accurate).
6. Trim the video according to the last TTS length of that scene. (e.g. scene 1 has 3 TTS, TTS 1 [00:00 - 00:02], TTS 2 [00:03 - 00:05], TTS [00:06 - 00:07]. This means the Veo video is trimmed to 7 seconds)
7. **Mute** Veo's original audio — only the Azure TTS track is audible. -> This video is what will be used as the last frame extractor for scenes that reference_from other scenes (continuous shot)

**Voice mapping:** the front-end passes the user's per-character voice selection (from Layer 1's `audios` config) into this layer; the layer maps each voice ID to its character.

---

## 9. Layer 7 — Music Generation Layer

**Goal:** Create background music from the prompt from blueprint.json

**Process**

1. Take the music_style from blueprint.json
2. Send prompt to **Google Lyria**
3. Save music background to \_storage/atlas_storyboard/run_0X/music_bg

**Voice mapping:** the front-end passes the user's per-character voice selection (from Layer 1's `audios` config) into this layer; the layer maps each voice ID to its character.

---

## 10. Layer 8 - Renderer Layer

1. Takes all generated scenes
2. Merges them together
3. Add greenscreen overlay transition after brolls with broll-type "opening" and "closing", before and after with broll-type "topic-transition", but the transition should be above the video layer so the overlays stacks above the video layer, not video -> transition -> video. But Video -transition-> video
4. Add subtitle
5. Add music in the background from the music generation layer
6. Loop music background to fit the merged video, add a crossfade to ensure a smooth loop and make the loops seamless

**Note**: Will have a dedicate API so that the front-end can request the successfully rendered video.
