"""
kie.ai ByteDance Seedance 2.5 video generation — test script.

Seedance 2.5 runs on kie.ai's unified Market "jobs" API, NOT the Veo endpoint.
That means a DIFFERENT endpoint and payload shape than the old Veo script:
params live inside a nested `input` object, and you poll a different URL with a
different success field. (Same jobs API shape as bench/test_image_kieai.py.)

Edit the CONFIG block below, then run:
    export KIE_API_KEY="your_key_here"     # get one at https://kie.ai/api-key
    python bench/test_video_kieai.py

Prints your credit balance before/after, the raw submit response, and the final
record payload, then reports the per-task cost (creditsConsumed) and the balance
diff so you see the actual cost.

Reference: https://kie.ai/seedance-2-5

=============================================================================
JOB MODES  ->  which image field is sent
=============================================================================
  text         no images, prompt only.
  first_frame  1 image -> input.first_frame_url. The image becomes the literal
               FIRST frame of the clip (most faithful when the whole frame
               should match one image), then the model animates from it.
  first_last   2 images -> first_frame_url + last_frame_url (a last frame
               always requires a first frame). Opening + closing frame match.
  reference    1+ images -> input.reference_image_urls. "Material" images the
               video is built around. Use this when you want the model to
               COMPOSE a scene that includes your image (e.g. a presenter on
               the left + your graph on the right). Up to 30 images.

  These modes cannot be combined in one request. Per kie.ai: when a shot must
  match a specific image EXACTLY, first/last frames beat references — but a
  reference is what lets the model place your image INTO a larger composition
  alongside generated content. For "character explains my graph", reference is
  the mode to test; expect the model to still reinterpret fine chart detail.

  Local files: any IMAGE_URLS entry that is NOT an http(s) URL is treated as a
  local path, uploaded to kie.ai's temporary file host, and the returned URL is
  used automatically (kie.ai fetches images server-side).

=============================================================================
PARAMETERS — POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask  (JSON body)
=============================================================================
  model   str   "bytedance/seedance-2-5".
  input   obj   nested, model-specific:
      prompt               str   (required) up to ~20,480 chars.
      first_frame_url      str   see JOB MODES.
      last_frame_url       str   see JOB MODES (requires first_frame_url).
      reference_image_urls list  see JOB MODES.
      duration             int   seconds, 4-30.
      resolution           str   "480p" | "720p" | "1080p" (draft = 480p only).
      aspect_ratio         str   "16:9","4:3","1:1","3:4","9:16","21:9","adaptive".
      output_format        str   "mp4" | "mov".
      generate_audio       bool  synchronized audio (on by default at kie.ai).

=============================================================================
RETURN FORMAT
=============================================================================
  Submit  -> {"code":200,"msg":"success","data":{"taskId":"task_..."}}
             HTTP 200 means CREATED, not finished (generation is async).

  GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=...  -> data:
      state           "waiting" | "queuing" | "generating" | "success" | "fail"
      resultJson      JSON *string*; parse it -> {"resultUrls": ["...mp4"]}
      creditsConsumed credits this task used  (per-task cost)
      failCode/failMsg failure detail when state == "fail"
      param/progress/costTime/createTime/completeTime
  Result URLs are temporary — download promptly.

=============================================================================
CREDIT COST
=============================================================================
  data.creditsConsumed reports the per-task cost directly; the script also
  diffs the account balance (GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/chat/credit) as a
  cross-check. Rates: https://kie.ai/billing ; per-task log: https://kie.ai/logs.
  Failed tasks are not charged; new accounts get 80 free credits.

PROMPT = """
A single corporate presenter stands on the LEFT third of the frame, turned
slightly toward the right, speaking to camera in and gesturing toward an image that
is displayed on the RIGHT side of the frame as if explaining it.

The presenter speaks the following line in English, and ONLY this line, with calm, clear, professional delivery and natural lip-sync:
{"Hello, good morning! Today I will explain to you the 3 stages of the innovation portofolio"}

THE IMAGE — STRICT: the image on the right is the provided reference image.
Reproduce it EXACTLY as given — THE SAME layout, colors, axes, gridlines,
labels, numbers, text, and proportions. Do NOT redraw, restyle, recolor,
relabel, translate, summarize, crop, warp, blur, add, remove, or regenerate any
part of the image. Every number and word on it must stay pixel-identical and
fully legible. It is a flat rectangular on-screen graphic panel on the right
side of the frame, not a 3D object, not a physical prop.

The presenter never overlaps, covers, or occludes the image. The image stays
fixed in place and completely unchanged for the entire clip — it does not move,
scale, rotate, slide, or animate. Only the presenter moves: natural explanatory
hand gestures toward the image, occasional glances at it and back to camera,
subtle, calm body movement.

Camera, STRICT: locked, static, eye-level medium-wide shot that keeps the
presenter on the left and the FULL image on the right in frame at all times. No
zoom, pan, tilt, dolly, push-in, orbit, handheld shake, or reframing. One
continuous static shot.

Setting: clean, softly lit modern corporate studio, neutral uncluttered
background. Professional explainer-video look.
