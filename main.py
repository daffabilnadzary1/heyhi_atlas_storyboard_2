THE RUN IS THE STATE
There is no database. A run_id names a directory under STORAGE_ROOT, and every
endpoint's precondition is "does the file the previous stage should have written
exist". That is why each handler opens with a cluster of 409 checks — those are
the pipeline's ordering constraints, expressed as file existence:

    config.json                 /pipeline/config       required by direct
    source.txt                  /pipeline/upload       required by direct
    blueprint.json              /pipeline/direct       required by select, music
    blueprint.placeholder.json  /pipeline/select       pristine pre-patch snapshot
    selections.json             /pipeline/select       required by assets, scenes
    backgrounds/, storyboard/   /pipeline/assets       required by scenes
    veo_raw/<id>.mp4            /pipeline/scenes       pristine clips; enable tts_only
    scenes/<id>.mp4             /pipeline/scenes       voiced + trimmed; required by render
    tts/                        L6                     voice wavs + timings sidecars
    tts/<id>.done               L6                     written last; marks a scene
                                                       finished, so resume can skip it
    cost_log.jsonl              L2 onward              one line per billed call
    music_bg/track.mp3          /pipeline/music        optional; render mixes it if present
    merged*.mp4, subs.srt       /pipeline/render       per-pass intermediates
    final.mp4                   /pipeline/render       the deliverable

Consequences to keep in mind: unfinished runs simply sit on disk, and a stage that
spends credits is guarded by an explicit flag rather than by a timestamp
comparison — so you can never regenerate something billable by accident, but you
also never regenerate it automatically when an input changes.

RESUMING. Two different things get called "resume" and it is worth keeping them
apart. Between stages, resuming has always just meant POSTing the next endpoint.
Within a stage, /pipeline/assets and /pipeline/scenes now take `resume=true`,
which keeps every artifact already on disk and generates only what is missing —
the recovery path for a stage that died at scene 7 of 9 with seven paid clips in
veo_raw/. `force=true` is the opposite and still means regenerate everything;
passing both is a 422. Resume looks at file existence only, so it cannot tell that
a blueprint changed underneath it: edit a prompt and you want force.

Handlers stay thin on purpose. Each one validates preconditions, builds its
clients through a `_*_client()` seam (lazily imported, so the API boots with no
keys and tests can substitute fakes), calls one pipeline function, and maps that
layer's error type onto a status code. The convention throughout:
    409 wrong order / already exists      422 bad input or invalid blueprint
    502 upstream provider failed          503 not configured (missing key/library)
