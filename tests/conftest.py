"""
Shared fixtures.

Everything in this suite is PURE — no network, no API keys, no ffmpeg, no
credits. That is possible because the pipeline's decision-making logic is
already separated from its I/O: validation, alignment, routing and patching are
all functions over plain data.

The golden fixture is REAL DIRECTOR OUTPUT (docs/examples/run_0616c9e5), not a
hand-written blueprint. It validates clean, so any test that mutates one field
and expects one problem is measuring exactly that rule and nothing else. A
synthetic fixture would drift away from what Gemini actually emits; this one
cannot, because it IS what Gemini emitted.

16 scenes, 5 topics, each opened by a storyboard-referenced scene, continued by
a scene: chain, and closed by a closing B-Roll.
