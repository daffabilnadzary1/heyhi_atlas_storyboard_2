"""
/pipeline/direct must record token spend even when the director FAILS.

REGRESSION GUARD. The first version of this instrumentation recorded tokens
after direct() returned. When the director exhausted its retries it raised, the
handler returned 502, and the recording line was never reached — so a run that
burned (max_retries + 1) billed Gemini calls recorded nothing at all.

That is backwards. A failing director is the EXPENSIVE case: every attempt is a
real, answered, billed API call; the only thing that failed was our own
validation of the content. Recording only on success hid exactly the spend worth
knowing about.

These tests use a fake DirectorLLM, so they exercise the endpoint's recording
logic with no network and no key.
